3.
To bring a dependency and update go.mod file with it, execute the following from the directory of go.mod file -
go get github.com/shpboris/usersdata@v1.0.1

4.
The source will be downloaded to pkg directory under location specified by GOPATH env variable.
[In my case GOPATH is C:\Users\shpilb\go]

5.
The import declaration consists of module name followed by full directories path.
Like - github.com/shpboris/usersdata
Then to use the function or var or struct from a file under directory above, the package specified in this file should
be used following by function/struct/var name like here - usersdata.User.
Package name can be different from directory name in which it (package) resides and from file name to which it (package) belongs.
